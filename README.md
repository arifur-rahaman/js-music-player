**Music Player**

A simple music player built with vanilla JavaScript, utilizing the `onloadedmetadata` event, a user-defined class for styling, CSS variables for dynamic theming, and `-webkit-appearance` and `-webkit-slider-thumb` for custom slider styling.

**Features:**

- **Basic playback controls:** Play, pause, seek, and volume adjustment.
- **Progress bar:** Visual representation of song playback.
- **Dynamic theming:** Customizable appearance using CSS variables.
- **Custom slider styling:** Enhanced slider look and feel using `-webkit-appearance` and `-webkit-slider-thumb`.

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

**Usage:**

- **Load your MP3 files:** Replace the placeholder song URLs in the HTML file with your desired tracks.
- **Interact with the player:** Use the play/pause button, seek bar, and volume slider to control playback.

**Customization:**

- **Theming:** Modify the CSS variables in the `style.css` file to change the player's colors and styles.
- **Functionality:** Customize the JavaScript code to add more features or modify existing behavior.

**Note:** This is a basic implementation and may require additional features or optimizations for production use.
